#+Title: DB Docs

Document your database tables and fields, because you should, and this
makes it easy.

DBDocs enables you to describe your database in a simple ORG file,
which is easy and nice to edit and search in your repo, view in your
SQL client, and publish as docs.

It works by converting a very minimal ORG-valid and -prescribed syntax
into SQL =COMMENT ON= statements, which can be run on your database
(via migration or sourced or however you like).

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="postico.png" /></p>

** Example

The following translation is done, from:

#+begin_src org
#+Title: ACME Corp Customer Database

* customer

The monster that holds the precious user profiles. Used by the traffic
light table to track which users …

- email ::
  The primary contact, taken from Salesforce’s
  =Project.Primary_Contact=. This is redundant with our =lead.contacs=
  data.

- email-data-json ::
  ...

* order

Every purchase made by =customer=s through the old portal. Note that
new purchases by customer through all other systems is recorded in the
=order2= table!

* ops-user

DEPRECATED: replaced by =agent=
#+end_src

to:

#+begin_src sql
COMMENT ON TABLE customer IS 'The monster …';
COMMENT ON COLUMN customer.email IS 'The primary contact, …';
…

COMMENT ON TABLE order IS 'Every purchase …';
…

#+end_src

That SQL is pretty ugly compared to the ORG version – that’s why this
tiny tool exists.

** Installation

- Install [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation][Babashka]].
- Clone this repo and put =dbdocs= on your =PATH=.

** Process

One time only, create a single living .org file in your repo, eg,
=docs/dbdocs.org= for growing docs for your tables.

Set up env vars to control file locations:

#+begin_src shell
export DBDOCS_ORG=docs
export DBDOCS_SQL=resouces/migrations
export DBDOCS_HTML=docs
#+end_src

Then, continually:

- Describe as many tables and columns as you see fit.

- Run =dbdocs docs/dbdocs.org= to generate a time-stamped file like
  =resources/migrations/20201027000000-dbdocs.up.sql=

- Commit both files.

- Run your migration, or just load the new SQL file.

** Transformations

Org uses underscores for italic, and it’s tedious enough to have wrap
every DB entity in equals (+=+) in org to escape them, so they should
instead be documented with hyphens (+-+) (though this isn’t required).
IOW, all ORG hyphenated variables (eg, =my-var-name=) become
underscores in SQL (=my_var_name=). So prefer to use =my-var-name= in
the ORG description.

The parser is really dumb (limited and rigid) and wants to see a
_table_ description for every table you wish to document. So, if you
want to document some column in a table, you must also provide at
least a tidbit sentence for the table too.

Alignment/indentation is important too, so follow the example format
precisely.

It you use “straight” apostrophes (='=), they’ll be converted to
curlies so as not to need SQL string escaping (and be prettier).
